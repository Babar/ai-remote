ASUSTek AI remote for Linux

Since I bought an ASUSTeK P5B-Premium Vista edition, it came
with an AI remote, and I wanted to enjoy it in linux (Ubuntu).

I stumbled upon Hogwog's python code here:
http://www.linux.com/community/blogs/ASUS-Ai-Remote-driver.html

His code worked, but didn't do some of the stuff I wanted,
such as moving inside the videos, therefore I forked it and
put it on github for others to do the same.

TODO:
Things I hope I'll do one day:
 - maybe port it in perl because I'm not so fluent in Python
 - allow application recognition to enable different bindings
 - make bindings configurable per user in a RC
 - enhance the driver removal code, as this should be done
   at the OS level using quirks to avoid running it as root
